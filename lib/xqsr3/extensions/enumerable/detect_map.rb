  # The +Enumerable+#+detect+ method provides a way to detect the presence
  # of a particular value in a collection. The only constraint is that you
  # get back the object unchanged.
  #
  # The +Enumerable+#+map+ method provides a way to transform the contents of
  # a collection. The only constraint is that you get back another
  # collection.
  #
  # This extension method, +Enumerable+#+detect_map+ combines the features
  # of both, in that it detects the presence of a particular value in a
  # collection and transform the detected value.
